#Reinforcement Learning(强化型機械學習)
* Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
* Nature : Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning

###Reinforcement Learning Applications

* Robotics: torque at joints
* Business operations
    - Inventory management: how much to purchase of inventory, spare
parts
    - Resource allocation: e.g. in call center, who to service first
* Finance: Investment decisions, portfolio design
* E-commerce/media
    - What content to present to users (using click-through / visit time as
reward)
    - What ads to present to users (avoiding ad fatigue)
    
###Audience
* Want to understand basic reinforcement learning (RL)
* No/weak math/computer science background
    - Q = r + Q
* Want to use RL as black-box with basic understanding
* Want to use TensorFlow and Python (optional labs)

###Open AI environment
* Open AI : framework of environment
    - https://gym.openai.com/
* agent(user, programmer) inform action such as up, down, left, right.
then environment return state and reward to agent.
